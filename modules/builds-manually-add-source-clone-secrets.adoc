= Manually Adding a Source Clone Secrets
Source clone secrets can be added manually to a build configuration by adding a
`sourceSecret` field to the `source` section inside the `BuildConfig` and
setting it to the name of the `secret` that you created (`basicsecret`, in this
example).

[source,yaml]

.Procedure

You can also use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the source clone
secret on an existing build configuration.

----
$ oc set build-secret --source bc/sample-build basicsecret
